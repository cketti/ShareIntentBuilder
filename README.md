An Android Library for the type-safe creation of Share Intents.

## Usage

Creating a simple share intent is as easy as this:

```java
Intent shareIntent = ShareIntentBuilder.from(activity)
        .text("Text to share")
        .build();
```

`ShareIntentBuilder` also supports adding optional extras and directly launching the share action:

```java
ShareIntentBuilder.from(activity)
        .text("Sharing is caring!")
        .subject("Very important message")
        .to("everyone@example.com")
        .cc("carebear@example.com")
        .share();
```

Of course sharing one or multiple data streams
(see [EXTRA_STREAM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#EXTRA_STREAM))
is also supported.

```java
ShareIntentBuilder.from(activity)
        // stream(Uri) will fetch the type using the ContentResolver
        // supplied by the activity (calls getType() on the content provider)
        .stream(MyContentProvider.getUriForItem(42))
        // you can avoid that by explicitly specifying the type
        .stream(Uri.parse("content://com.example.provider/23"), "image/png")
        .share();
```

According to the documentation supplying both
[EXTRA_TEXT](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#EXTRA_TEXT) and
[EXTRA_STREAM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#EXTRA_STREAM) is not allowed.
However, some receiving apps support this. So if you really have to, you can use `ShareIntentBuilder` to do this by
calling `ignoreSpecification()` first.

```java
ShareIntentBuilder.from(activity)
        .ignoreSpecification()
        .text("EXTRA_TEXT content that may or may not be used by the receiving app")
        .stream(Uri.parse("content://com.example.provider/42"), "application/octet-stream")
        .share();
```


## Include the library

The easiest way to add the library to your project is via Gradle. Add the following lines to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'de.cketti.share:share-intent-builder:0.0.2'
}
```

To tell Gradle where to find the library, make sure `build.gradle` also contains this:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

Note: `jcenter()` - the new default when creating projects with Android Studio - will work as well.
